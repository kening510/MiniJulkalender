Day 1: We watched her grow up.
Day 2: She was the urgent chirper,
Day 3: Fledgling flier.
Day 4: And when spring rolled
Day 5: Out its green
Day 6: She’d grown
Day 7: Into the most noticeable
Day 8: Bird-girl.
Day 9: Long-legged and just
Day 10: The right amount of blush
Day 11: Tipping her wings, crest
Day 12: And tail, and
Day 13: She knew it
Day 14: In the bird parade.
Day 15: We watched her strut.
Day 16: She owned her stuff.
Day 17: The males perked their armor, greased their wings,
Day 18: And flew sky-loop missions
Day 19: To show off
Day 20: For her.
Day 21: In the end
Day 22: There was only one.
Day 23: Isn’t that how it is for all of us?
Day 24: There’s that one you circle back to — for home.
